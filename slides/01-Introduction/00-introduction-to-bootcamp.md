## Our goals for the gem5 bootcamp

- Make gem5 less painful and flatten the learning curve
- Give you a vocabulary for asking questions​
- Provide a reference for the future​
- Give you material to take back and teach your colleagues

### Other likely outcomes

- You will be overwhelmed by the amount of information and how large gem5 is
  - That's OK! You can take these materials with you and refer back to them
- You will not understand everything
  - That's OK! You can ask questions as we go

---

## How this is going to work

- We'll be going mostly top-down
  1. How to use gem5
  2. How to each model can be used
  3. How to develop your own models and modify existing models
- Highly iterative:
  - You'll see the same thing over and over
  - Each time it will be one level deeper
- Lots of coding examples
  - Both live coding and practice problems

---

## Coding examples

You can write the following code

```python
print("Hello, world!")
print("You'll be seeing a lot of Python code")
print("The slides will be a reference, but we'll be doing a lot of live coding!")
```

And you'll see this output.

```console
Hello, world!
You'll be seeing a lot of Python code
The slides will be a reference, but we'll be doing a lot of live coding!
```

---

## Bootcamp logistics

We'll be here from 9am - 4pm each day.

Lunch will be ~12 - 1pm.

We'll have a breaks in the morning and afternoon.

Afternoon break will have coffee/snacks.

Tonight: Reception at [Dunloe Brewing](https://dunloebrewing.com/) (Olive Drive Brewery)
5:30pm - 8:00pm. Walking over at 5pm from here.

Wednesday: Social event at UC Davis ["Games Area"](https://memorialunion.ucdavis.edu/games-area) (Bowling, pool, video games, etc.)
6:30pm - 9:30pm.
